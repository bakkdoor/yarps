== How to start:
Check out the src/ folder and play around with it. It's just another rails app, so you should get going pretty fast.
It was started as a german-documented project but there has been done some work to make it all in english, including comments etc.
If you find any stuff thats still in german, let me now or change it yourself (if you understand german).
