=========================================== How to start ===========================================

Check out the src/ folder and play around with it. It's just another rails app, so you should get going pretty fast.
Just make sure to change the yarps-configuration (src/config/yarps_config.yml) accordingly to your host & mail
settings, since you'll want to make sure, your mailer works correctly (and some other stuff as well).

You'll also need the latest version of rails, which was released Sep. 05 2008.
Get it via rubygems: sudo gem install rails --version 2.1.1

  
It was started as a german-documented project but there has been done some work to make it all in english, including comments etc.
If you find any stuff that's still in german, let me know or change it yourself (if you understand german). It should all be in english
by now, but you never know...
