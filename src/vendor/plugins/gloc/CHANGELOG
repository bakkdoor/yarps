== Version 1.2 (11 Feb 2007)

* Added language select-tag functions
* Localized values can now be CustomTypes.
* Localized values can now be basic ruby types (true/false, Fixnum, Symbol, Array, Hash)
* Localized values can now be procs, lambdas.
* Added a custom type called 'sameas' which can be used to make a value the same as another.
* Fixed bug in ActiveRecord::Errors.add
* Added methods: l_without_args, ll_without_args, ltry_without_args
* date_select and datetime_select now use a default :order param (d/m/y) which is specified in lang files
* Added a yesno_radio_buttons() method for views.
* Date/time formats no longer need double percentage signs. (%%d/%%m -> %d/%m)
* Removed l_datetime_short().
* Added French strings. (Thanks to François Billard-Madrières)
* Date/time functions now localize the weekday/month names.
* Updated to work with Rails v1.2.1
* All internal constants moved out of the GLoc module so they are no longer inherited.
* Added two modes of get/set current_language functionality. In simple mode (which is the new default) the current_language setting is global. In cascading mode (the previous default) the current_language can be configured at instance, class and global levels. What this means is that you will now no longer need to manually set the language of models after already setting the language in the controller (unless running in the old cascading mode).
* autodetect_language_filter now parses HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE correctly and takes language weights into consideration.
